            <h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>
                <p>
                    Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see copyright ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74
                    <br>
                    but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive files (.tar.Z). To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-
                         
                         <ul>       
                                ftp_info.cern.ch
                                <br>
                                Enter user name: anonymous
                                <br>
                                Password: me@myhost.edu
                                <br>
                                ftp> cd /pub/www/src
                                <br>
                                ftp> binary
                                <br>
                                ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
                                <br>
                                ftp> quit
                                <br>
                                >    
                        </ul> 
                    <br>
                <p> The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                             uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it,
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                             tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now you should install the line mode browser , install the server , install Viola , etc.
                    <br>
