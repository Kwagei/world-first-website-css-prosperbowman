                    Making HTML into TeX
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We did this with the "WWW Book" to print it. See the <a href="">Makefile</a> for example, and the scripts <a href="">html2latex.sed</a> and <a href="">sub1.sed</a>. We wrote a special introduction, but otherwise
                    <br>
                    all the text was hypertext from the W3 project.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are scripts for generating SGML hypertext from things like directory listings, etc. Also, for checking and correcting dubious HTML.

                    Server log analysis
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Analysing server logs requires first of all changing the numeric internet node numebrs into domain names. httpd-analyse.c is a program to do that.
