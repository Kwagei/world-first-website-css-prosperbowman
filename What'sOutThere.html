        <h1>General Overview</h1>
            <p>
            There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="#">by Subject</a>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.
            <br>
            <a href="#">by Type</a>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="#">About the W3 project</a>.
