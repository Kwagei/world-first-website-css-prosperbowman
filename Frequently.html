            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions on W3</h1>
                <p>
                    An FAQ list is really a cop-out from managed information. You should be able to find everything you want to know by browsing from the WWW project page,
                    <br>
                    as everything should be arranged in a logical way. Here though are things which maybe didn't fit into the structure, with pointers to the answers
                    <br>
                    which maybe did. Its an experiment, started May 92. The questioners are anonymous.
