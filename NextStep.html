                    The "WorldWideWeb" application for the NeXT is a prototype Hypertext browser/editor. It allows direct access to Hypertext servers, files and news. See also further information:

                <h2>General</h2>
                <p>
                    When you double-click on the WorldWideWeb icon, the application by default displays your own home page, ~/WWW/default.html, or failing that the system home page,
                    <br>
                    /usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html. From then on, if you want to select a document referred to by a page being displayed, you just double click on an areas of gray
                    <br>
                    text. (Gray was chosen so as not to use up other highlighting techniques such as bold or italic, which authors may want to use for other things.
                    <br>
                    When color comes along, we can use colour...)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you double-click anywhere else in the document, you will select a word, as is usual on the NeXT.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some gray areas lead to whole documents, while some bring up a document with a particular target area highlighted. This is called the destination anchor.
                    It is not gray unless it in turn leads somewhere else, but double clicking on a destination anchor selects the whole anchor.
                </p>
                    <h2>Indexes</h2>
                <p>
                    Certain documents are indexes. They normally have only a small amount of text. You cannot read the index yourself (it may be very big). To access something 
                    <br>
                    through the index, use the "Keyword search" menu option. The window with the index in it must be the main window (dark title bar) when you use the keyword
                    <br>
                    search panel. The rules used by indexes to search for matches vary. Different indexes use different techniques, and cover different ranges of information.
                    <br>
                    When a search is successful, the result is a page of references to documents. You select documents from it by double clicking in the usual way.
                </p>
