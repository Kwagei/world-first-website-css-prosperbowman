            <h1>W3 servers software</h1>
                <p>
                    A W3 server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.
                </p>
            <h1>The basic daemon</h1>
                <p>
                    The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes: 
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">User guide</a></li>.
                        <li><a href="#">Internals -- a description of the code</a></li>.
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Tools for information providers </a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Making a new server</h2>
                <p>
                    This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Writing a server in C</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#">Writing a server as a script</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server. 
                </p>

                <h2>Other servers and Gateways</h2>
                <p>
                    These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.
